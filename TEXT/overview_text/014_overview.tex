Ingersoll Houses is a conventional development built in 1944 with federal funding in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. The site is comprised of twenty 6-11 story residential buildings totaling 1,840 units, along with a community center and a clinic nearby (Cumberland Medical Center). Spanning across 20.3 acres, Ingersoll has a total population of 4,129. 

Residents are asked to place household trash in one of 45 drop-off sites located in front of each building. Recycling bins are also placed throughout the premises. Caretakers collect trash from the drop-off sites and bring it to one of three exterior compactors located within the development.
