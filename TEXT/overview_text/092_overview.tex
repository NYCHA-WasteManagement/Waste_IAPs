Overview

Bayview Houses is a conventional development consisting of 23 eight-story residential buildings, a community center, and a community farm. Totaling 1,610 units, Bayview has a total population of 3,459 and covers 34.02 acres. The development, built in 1956, is financed by both NYCHA and HPD in an effort to rehabilitate vacant units in order to boost the population of underutilized NYCHA properties. Tenants drop off their household waste in the rear of buildings and at various non-designated drop-off sites throughout the location. Caretakers then collect the waste and bring it to one of four exterior compactors located on this site. There are recycling bins, however, scattered throughout the site.
