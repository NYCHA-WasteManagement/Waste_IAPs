    Jackie Robinson Consolidated has (2) 30-cubic yard exterior compactors. On average, the exterior compactors at this consolidation contain 4.8 tons of waste at the time of collection. DSNY prefers compactors to contain more than 7 tons and up to 12 tons at collection. The closer to 12 tons, the more efficient collection is for both DSNY and the consolidation.
