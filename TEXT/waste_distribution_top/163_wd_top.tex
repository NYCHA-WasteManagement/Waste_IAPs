    By understanding how much waste is generated at each consolidation, planners and managers
    can better determine how well current assets and services serve current needs, and what additional 
    elements are necessary in order for each consolidation to operate as efficiently as possible. 

    Wyckoff Gardens Consolidated has (3) 30-CY external compactors, each with a footprint of 192 square feet. Given the rate at which waste is produced at NYCHA properties, these containers will fill
    up in about (4.8) days.
