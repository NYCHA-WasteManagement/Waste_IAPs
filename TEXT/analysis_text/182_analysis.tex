The consolidation also reported that it received no bulk tickets for the removal of bulk waste due to the fact that they have a bulk crusher on the site.

In terms of storage, residents of this consolidation have access to trash chutes and may drop their waste at 3 additional sites on the premises. After the trash is collected from the drop-off sites, it is placed in the exterior compactor. Tenants are asked by management not to leave their garbage on development grounds if they choose not to use the chutes. Most tenants dispose of their trash using the shoot system. Waste is stored in the exterior compactor.
