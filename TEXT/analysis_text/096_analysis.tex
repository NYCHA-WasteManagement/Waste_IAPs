The Property Manager, Jenny Amaya, reported that it does not have enough staff to correct observed deficiencies and caretakers can usually complete all of their tasks in a day. NYCHA caretakers pick up trash inside the buildings 1-2 times a day, including weekends. NYCHA caretakers also conduct[ed] ground inspections and pick[ed] up litter 1-2 times a day, including weekends. Staff begins collecting trash between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily. 

\textbf{Removal or Storage Requirement}

At the time of the compliance interview, Tilden appeared to be in compliance with the storage and removal requirement of Paragraph 45 of the HUD Agreement because it does have containers in the form of exterior compactors to store waste in a manner that prevents pests on the days DSNY does not come to pick up waste.

Tilden reported at the time of the interview that DSNY comes on Tuesdays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays. The consolidation also reported that it received 4 bulk tickets for the removal of bulk waste. The Property Manager stated that 2-4 more are needed. Bulk trash sits in a yard with an exterior container before being picked up by the vendor. In terms of storage, residents of this consolidation have access to trash chutes and may drop their waste at 7 additional sites on the premises. After the trash is collected from the drop-off sites, it is placed in the exterior compactor. Tenants are asked by management not to leave their garbage on development grounds if they choose not to use the chutes. Most tenants dispose of their trash using shoots or nondesignated drop-off sites. Waste is stored in the exterior compactor. 

The consolidation reported that on average, 50-100 compactor bags (40 lbs. bags) are disposed of from Tilden daily. There are 2 exterior compactors at this consolidation.
