\textbf{Inspection and Collection Requirement}

The consolidation appeared to be in compliance with the inspection and collection requirements of Paragraph 45 of the HUD agreement. Compliance could not conduct a site visit during the 2019-2020 period; however, in a survey conducted in the summer of 2020, the consolidation reported the following conditions.

The Assistant Property Maintenance Superintendent, Robert Craigwell, reported that O'Dwyer does have enough staff to correct observed deficiencies and caretakers can usually complete all of their tasks in a day. NYCHA caretakers pick up trash inside the buildings two times a day, including weekends. NYCHA caretakers also conduct ground inspections and pick up litter two times a day, including weekends. Staff begins collecting trash at 6:15 AM and ends at 6:15 PM daily. 

\textbf{Removal or Storage Requirement}

All of the developments at this consolidation have their trash collected from the curbside and because DSNY does not pick up from the curb everyday there is a high likelihood that this site is not in compliance as they cannot store waste in an exterior compactor on days when DSNY cannot pick up.

O'Dwyer reported at the time of the survey that DSNY comes three times a week. The consolidation also reported that it received eight bulk tickets a month for the removal of bulk waste. Bulk trash sits in a yard with an exterior container before being picked up by the vendor. In terms of storage, residents of this consolidation have access to trash chutes and may drop their waste at  additional sites on the premises. Most tenants dispose of their trash at designated drop-off sites. Once waste is collected from the grounds, waste is placed in a compound area before collection by DSNY

The consolidation reported that, on average, fewer than 100 compactor bags (40 lbs. bags) are disposed of from O'Dwyer daily. There are three 30-yard bulk containers and 22 interior compactors. Two interior compactors are shutdown at buildings 12 and 14.

According to the survey, there are external sources of trash and bulk waste illegally dumped at this site. (When it happens, it is from nearby homeowners. Mr. Craigwell reported that there is occasional pest problems which he attributes to ongoing renovations from Hurricane Sandy.
