Bayview appears to be in compliance with paragraph 45 of the HUD agreement, according to a Compliance Interview conducted on December 6th, 2019. 

According to Alab Taylor, the Supervisor of Caretakers, the staff inspects the grounds for trash and pest issues, removes litter, and collects household trash 1-2 times daily. He has stated that there is a sufficient amount of manpower to correct most observed deficiencies. Trash is collected from non designated sites starting between 8am and 10am and complete the last drop-off before 4pm. There are 23 interior compactor rooms, all of which are accessible. The site collects about 100-200 compactor bags daily. The trash is taken to one of four exterior compactors located on the premises and stored in EZ packs. Bayview stores trash in a manner that prevents pest issues.

There are two bulk containers on this site. Bulk collection by DSNY occurs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, or whenever called if the external compactor is too full. Bayview is offered over 8 bulk tickets monthly and bulk trash is stored in the same yard as the exterior compactor. However, Mr. Taylor explains that an obstacle his staff faces is the need for designated areas for bulk trash. External sources of trash include debris from nearby construction.
