\textbf{Inspection and Collection Requirement}

Howard Houses appears to be in compliance with the inspection and collection requirements of paragraph 45 of the HUD agreement, according to a Compliance Interview conducted on December 3rd, 2019. According to Norman Buie, Supervisor of Grounds, caretakers inspect the premises for pest and trash issues 1-2 times daily, and once on weekends. They also pick up litter and collect trash 1-2 times daily, starting from 6-8am to before 4pm. He also explains that there is sufficient manpower to correct most observed deficiencies and staff are able to complete all tasks in one day. Howard takes trash to the Tilden and Van Dyke developments if necessary, and the Hughes, Brownsville, and Tilden developments take trash to Howard if necessary.

\textbf{Removal or Storage Requirement} 

Howard Houses does not appear to be in compliance with paragraph 45 of the HUD agreement, according to a Compliance Interview conducted on December 3rd, 2019. There are 11 drop-off sites on the premises, in which some of these bins have no lids. Waste is also placed at the drop-off site, but not in bins. Therefore, trash is not stored in a manner that prevents pest access. New trash cans with lids were provided to tackle this issue, Mr. Buie states. Further research must be conducted. Upon removal, trash is taken to one of two exterior compactors located on the premises. There are 16 interior compactor rooms, all of which are accessible. 

There are two bulk containers located at Howard. Bulk trash sits in the yard with the exterior compactor for pickup by DSNY 1-2 times weekly, on Mondays and Fridays. This site is given 3-4 bulk tickets monthly. Howard disposes of less than 100 compactor bags daily.
