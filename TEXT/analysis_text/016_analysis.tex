NYCHA caretakers also conduct ground inspections and pick up litter [FREQUENCY] times a day, including weekends. Staff begins collecting trash between 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily.

 

\textbf{Removal or Storage Requirement} 

The consolidation appeared to be in compliance with the  removal or storage requirement of Paragraph  45 of the HUD Agreement because it has containers in the form of exterior compactors to store waste in a manner that prevents pests on the days DSNY does not come to pick up waste. Based on the same summer of  2020 survey, the consolidation reported the following conditions.

 

--- 

Brownsville reported at the time of the survey that DSNY comes Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The consolidation also reported that it received 5 bulk tickets a month for the removal of bulk waste. Bulk trash sits in a yard with an exterior container before being picked up by the vendor. In terms of storage, residents of this consolidation [HAVE/DO NOT HAVE] access to trash chutes and may drop their waste at 16 additional sites on the premises. After the trash is collected from the drop-off sites, it is placed in the exterior compactor. Tenants are not asked by management to leave their garbage on development grounds if they are unable or choose not to use the chutes. Most tenants dispose of their trash [DISPOSAL METHOD]. Once waste is collected from the grounds, waste is stored in the exterior compactor.  

 

The consolidation reported that, on average, 100-200 compactor bags (40 lbs. bags) are disposed of from Brownsville daily. There are 3 exterior compactors at this consolidation.

 

According to the survey, there are external sources of trash and bulk waste illegally dumped at this site. When it happens, it is from unknown sources, who usually dump bulk trash.
